\para{Abstract.} 
% Collaborative writing plays a central role in our professional life.
This project investigates how intelligent agents can support collorative writing, a ubiquitous activity in human productivity.
To do that, we develop computational algorithms to provide two types of suggestions: collaboration suggestions and content suggestions.
We will further explore the design space of how these suggestions will be provided and integrated in the collaborative writing process.
We consider diverse writing tasks, including potentially working with real users to create content on Wikipedia.
In addition to two-person synchronous collaborations, we will also examine five-person teams to pave the road for future work on collaborative writing.
Success in this project will promote the vision of human-centered AI and enhance the productivity in a wide range of collaborative settings.
