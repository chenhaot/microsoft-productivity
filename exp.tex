\section{Experimental Design}

In this section, we outline the experiments we plan to conduct in this project. Specifically, we envision a set of 4 behavioral experiments to advance the understandings on how to better design machine-generated suggestions to enhance the productivity in collaborative writing. We first design three experiments (\secref{sec:exp1}---\ref{sec:exp3}) to examine the effectiveness of various collaboration suggestions and content suggestions in the context of collaborative writing within a team of two people. We then discuss in \secref{sec:exp4} the additional challenges and opportunities for experimental studies on machine-in-the-loop collaborative writing when a significantly larger number of individuals participate in the writing process.
