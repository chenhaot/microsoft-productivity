\section{Researcher roles, Timeline, and Use of Funds}

\para{Roles.}
PI Tan will lead the design of computational algorithms and models required to offer suggestions in the collaborative writing process;
PI Yin will lead the design and development of online experiments.
We expect our graduate students to work closely on every component of this proposal.
We will make sure that the PIs and graduate students meet regularly to seamlessly integrate research efforts at two Universities.


\para{Timeline.} We expect an approximate timeline as follows.

\begin{itemize}
    \item 01/2020 --- 06/2020. Collect relevant data, develop required algorithms, models, and webapps.
    \item 07/2020 --- 10/2020. Pilot initial experiments and refine the algorithms using slogan writing.
    \item 11/2020 --- 01/2021. Extend results to other writing tasks and further refine the design of algorithms, models, and webapps.
    \item 02/2020 --- 05/2021. Finish all experiments and prepare writing and demos to disseminate the research outcomes.
\end{itemize}

\para{Use of funds.} We request \$250,000 in total, which will be evenly split between these two University.
The Colorado part will be used for the following purposes:

In addition, we request \$150,000 Azure credits for developing computational models and hosting the webapp for collaborative writing.


\para{Resources.} If possible, it would be useful to share existing collaborative writing datasets in Microsoft.
